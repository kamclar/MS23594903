Functional Enrichment Analysis Results - explanation
==========================================================================

Both Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed using multiple gene set libraries (GO, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways).

------------------------------------------------------------
Dir Structure
------------------------------------------------------------

ORA
   - Over-representation analysis using all identified proteins.
   - CSV tables with enriched terms.
     * Bubble plots: X = enrichment ratio, size = overlap count, color = -log10(p).
     * Bar plots: Bars sorted by enrichment ratio, colored by -log10(p).

ORA_top_percentile
   - ORA restricted to the top intensity percentile proteins.
   - Highlights pathways enriched in the most abundant proteins.
   - Bubble + bar plots (PNG + SVG).

GSEA_full_rank
   - GSEA prerank results using the full ranked protein list.
   - Subfolders for each database.
   - "prerank/" directories contain one plot per enriched term (running enrichment score curves).
   - Useful for detailed diagnostic inspection - this was mainly for me.

dual_plots/GSEA/
   - Summary GSEA plots for each database.
   - Top enriched pathways only (e.g. top 20).
   - Scatter plots: NES vs. pathway (size = |NES|, color = -log10(FDR/p)). NES = normalized enrichment score
   - Bar plots: NES values sorted, colored by -log10(FDR/p).

tables
   - Gene-level and enrichment result CSVs (all terms, not just top N).
   - Useful for downstream analysis.

plots
   - Additional bubble + bar plots generated during analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
- ORA: "Are certain pathways overrepresented among my selected genes?"
  why ORA? using full gene set would create noisy results
- GSEA: "Do genes from certain pathways cluster at the top or bottom of the ranked list?"
- Both methods have something good.
- Protein intensity was used as a proxy for abundance when ranking.

------------------------------------------------------------
How to Read the Plots
------------------------------------------------------------
- Bubble plot:
  * X-axis: enrichment ratio (observed/expected overlap).
  * Size: number of overlapping genes (k).
  * Color: significance (-log10(p) or -log10(FDR)).

- Bar plot:
  * X-axis: enrichment ratio (ORA) or NES (GSEA).
  * Bars sorted from strongest to weakest enrichment.
  * Color: significance (-log10(p) or -log10(FDR)).

Notes for thought
------------------------------------------------------------

Regulators vs. structural proteins
- Structural / housekeeping proteins (tubulin, actin, ribosomal proteins) are super abundant → they dominate the intensity ranking.
- Regulatory proteins (transcription factors, kinases, signaling molecules) are often low copy number...


Viral/host interaction factors
- In infection or inoculum, viral proteins or host restriction factors may be of low abundance?
- They may still be critical for the phenotype, even though they may not always be among the top n% of abundant proteins.


Technical sensitivity
- Mass spec has a dynamic range limit: a small regulatory protein may appear with low intensity simply because it’s harder to ionize/detect...
