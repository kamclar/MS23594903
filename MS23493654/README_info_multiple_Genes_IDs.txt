Cox & Mann, Nat Biotech 2008 :
“Peptides that can be assigned to multiple proteins are assembled into protein groups, and a leading protein is reported to represent the group.”


Perseus User Guide:
“Each protein group is represented by one leading protein, which should be used for annotation and downstream analyses to avoid artificial inflation of protein counts.”


Vizcaíno et al., Proteomics 2014 (PSI guidelines):
“Indistinguishable proteins based on shared peptides should be reported as protein groups, with a single representative accession designated for downstream annotation.”


Practical proteomics workflow guides

Tyanova et al., Nat Protocols 2016 (MaxQuant/Perseus tutorial):
“For downstream enrichment analyses, only the leading protein of each group should be considered, since expanding all possible proteins would bias the results.”
