This figure is a sample–sample Pearson correlation heatmap based on the protein intensity profiles (each cell shows how similar two samples are across all measured proteins). The diagonal is 1 (each sample perfectly correlates with itself), while off-diagonal colors represent correlation strength (warmer = more similar / higher correlation, cooler = less similar / lower correlation). Samples are hierarchically clustered (trees on top/left) using the correlation distances, so samples with the most similar proteome patterns are placed next to each other. The colored bars/labels indicate experimental groups, allowing you to visually check whether biological replicates cluster together as expected. Clear blocks of high within-group correlation suggest good replicate consistency, whereas samples that cluster away from their group or show unusually low correlations may indicate outliers, batch effects, or technical variability.
