Pearson sample–sample correlation analysis was used to assess replicate consistency across groups. Replicates clustered most tightly for BD and BDM (followed by D), indicating good within-group reproducibility. In contrast, B1 showed the weakest within-group similarity (and the highest within-group variability), with BM2, B2, DM, and BM1 also showing lower replicate concordance. Several samples had the lowest within-group correlations in their respective groups (e.g., B1_2, BM2_4, B2_2, DM_2, BM1_1), and were therefore prioritized for additional QC checks.
